  <h2>Ingredient</h2>
  <p>You will need the following ingredients
    <ul>
      <li>3 tbsp sunflower oil</li>
      <li>1kg braising steak, diced</li>
      <li>2 onions, roughly chopped</li>
      <li>3 tbsp plain flour</li>
      <li>1 tbsp tomato ketchup</li>
      <li>2 beef stock cubes mixed with 600ml boiling water</li>
      <li>375g sheet of ready-rolled puff pastry</li>
      <li>1 egg yolk, beaten</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>To make the filling, heat the oven to 160C/140C fan/gas 3. Heat half the oil in a large casserole dish, brown the meat really well in batches, then set aside. Add the onions adding a drizzle more oil, then cook on a low heat for 5 mins until coloured.</li>
    <li>Scatter over the flour, stirring until the flour turns brown. Tip the meat and any juices back into the pan along with the ketchup and give it all a good stir. Pour over the stock, season, and bring to a simmer then cover with a lid and put in the oven for about 2 hrs, until the meat is tender. The filling can be made up to three days ahead and chilled or frozen for up to three months.</li>
    <li>To make the pie, heat the oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Tip the filling into a 24-26cm rimmed pie dish and brush the rim of the dish with some yolk. Unravel the pastry, drape over the dish and use a knife to trim and press the edges against the side of the dish. Re-roll your trimmings to make a decoration if you like. Brush the pie heavily with egg yolk. Make a few little slits in the centre of the pie and bake for 40 mins until golden. Leave to stand for a few minutes before serving.</li>
